:: DESCRIPTION ::

This is a Next Gen Update of BetterMovement, all credit goes to ArmadilloMan, who seems to be gone since quite some time. So, in accordance with their released permissions, I patched their great mod up for next gen.

Original mod description:
This mod attempts to fix the unresponsive movement from the game. Although the alternative movement helped, it still wasn't terribly responsive. There are 4 presets for each category of change: vanilla, fast, faster, and fastest. You can also modify each aspect individually or turn on real-time mode, which effectively makes Geralt move like he's from DOOM.


:: INSTALLATION ::

Install using TW3MM﻿ (recommended) or manually by copying the folder modBetterMovement into your [The Witcher 3]\mods directory.
Enable the ingame menu by copying the following line into both dx11filelist.txt and dx12filelist.txt in your [The Witcher 3]\bin\config\r4game\user_config_matrix\pc\ folder.
	modBetterMovement.xml;

If you installed using TW3MM, you can also use Menu Filelist Updater to automate step 2.


:: RECOMMENDED MODS ::

This mod pairs very well with "Smooth Movement".

It is also recommended when using "Gervant First Person﻿", if you also play in third person occasionally. This mod functions as an alternative to GFP_Strafe, one of the optional modules of Gervant First Person. If you play in first person exclusively, GFP_Strafe is the better option, 'though.
